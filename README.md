# sds-tests

This repository contains a collection of test programs that exercise various
Mochi components (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mochi/).

These test programs are independent from individual component repositories
because they either a) test multiple components simultaneously or b) are
intended for use in regression tests in which the Mochi environment has
already been configured.
