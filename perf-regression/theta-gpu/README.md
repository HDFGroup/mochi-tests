This is an example script for executing an automated regression test on the 
Thetagpu system at the ALCF.  The entire process is handled by the 
"./gpu-qsub" script.  The script can be copied to a desired location where
the test may be run and submitted via "qsub ./gpu-qsub" on a 
thetagpu service node.
